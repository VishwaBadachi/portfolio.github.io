    <p>
        Starlink's ground station network acts as the terrestrial endpoint for satellite internet. Ground stations (or gateways) are distributed geographically and are connected to the broader internet infrastructure. Each satellite maintains a connection to at least one ground station when possible.

When a satellite cannot reach its default ground station due to congestion, failure, or weather-related issues, it must quickly re-route its data through other available ground stations. To ensure resilience, Starlink uses a failover system that dynamically computes the best ground station route using a modified version of multi-source routing algorithms and live telemetry.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>System Design Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Starlink ground stations are grouped into failover zones to ensure continuous service if a station fails. To precompute these zones, a KD-tree spatial index is constructed over all ground stations based on their coordinates.
        Each station performs a range query on the KD-tree to find all neighbors within a predefined radius (e.g., 300 km). These neighboring stations are merged into the same failover zone using a Union-Find data structure that efficiently maintains disjoint sets.
        This hybrid method ensures fast spatial queries and logical grouping of stations, enabling effective failover management.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The KD-tree organizes ground stations in k-dimensional space, allowing fast queries to find nearby stations. For each station, neighbors within the failover radius are found using a range query.
        Union-Find merges these stations into groups, ensuring that each failover zone is a connected cluster. The final result is a collection of disjoint sets representing failover zones, which can be queried efficiently during operation.

  <h2>Inference</h2>
  <p>
    This business case demonstrates how Starlink ensures high availability and resilience in its ground station network through precomputed failover zones. By leveraging a spatial indexing structure (KD-tree) for proximity queries and a Union-Find data structure for set formation, the system efficiently clusters ground stations into zones that can dynamically handle traffic redirection in the event of outages, congestion, or environmental disturbances.
  </p>
  <p>
    The KD-tree allows fast geographic queries even in large deployments, while Union-Find ensures minimal overhead in managing zone memberships. The tradeoff between performance and responsiveness to topological change is evident, highlighting the need for periodic recomputation. Overall, this hybrid approach offers a scalable, fault-tolerant solution for terrestrial link management in satellite internet infrastructure.
